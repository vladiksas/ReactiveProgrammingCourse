Having several information sources (a.k.a <code>Publisher</code>) you need to
subscribe to all of them and consume the whole stream only from the one which answered
earlier than others
<div class="hint">
    Use <code>Flux.first</code>. Basically it perform racing between all the sources so
    the winner becomes the main source.
